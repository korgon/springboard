## Learning

A scaffolding tool was not used to build out this project. The minimal, modular, middleware focused HTTP framework, KOA, was chosen to build to serve up a front end built around an API. Browsersync provides the browser refreshing and synchronization across multiple browsers and CSS injection.

Many of the concepts used in this project are new concepts...we are forever learning...

Jumping into it all can be very intimidating, as there are some many choices and opinions... not to mention the opionionated choices. So here is an opionionated start on if you want to develop web applications with Javascript today.

Provided are some good starting point to learn programing with Javascript and node.js, or if you need a refresher. Packages used by Springboard are also touched on in the specific packages used section.

## Git

## Software
##### Atom
https://atom.io/  
After learning so much Javascript, why not use an editor that is built with it...  
It is completely hackable using all of your developing Javascript skills.  
Comes with a great set of features out of the box including a package manager.
The seti themes are highly recommended and pleasant to look at.
